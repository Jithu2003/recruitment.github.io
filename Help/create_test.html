<p>The Create test Utility allows the <a href = "admin.html">Administrator</a> to create a <a href = "test.html">Test</a> pattern. This <a href = "test.html">Test</a> pattern would later be used to <a href = "publish.html">Publish</a> the test for a particular <a href = "category.html">Category</a>. Each <a href = "test.html">Test</a> created is unique by its name event the settings are same for more than one test. So if the user enters the name of the test which is already present in the database then the system will prompt to enter an alternate test name. One can skillfully create such customized <a href = "test.html">Test</a> patterns and reuse them for more than one tests.</p>

<p> This Utility is only available for those <a href="admin.html">Administrators </a> who have the authority to Create Tests and Manage Exam. See the <a href="accessibility.html">Accessibility Options </a>for more details.
<p> <span class="style1">Warning</span> : It is better that the Administrator should first <a href="server_mgmt.html">Shut the User Server </a> before he creates a <a href = "test.html">Test</a>.
