<p>The Create Post Utility allows the <a href = "admin.html">Administrator</a> to create a <a href = "post.html">Post</a> ie. the job position in the company for which candidates should be recruited. The <a href = "post.html">Post</a> is created as per the pattern specified in the <a href = "post.html">Post</a> specifications according to the requirments of the company. Each <a href = "post.html">Post</a> is unique and the system will prompt if the post name specified in the <a href="create_post.html">create post</a> is already present. The candidates can apply to the post if and only if there is atleast one vacant position for that post and there is atleast one category of test present in the <a href = "post.html">Post</a>.</p>

<p>The management of the company can decide the specifications for the job position depending on their requirements. Then the system automatically checks the eligibility of the applying candidate and sorts out the desired candidates to be selected in the <a href = "view_sel.html">view selected candidates</a>.
<p>This Utility is only available for those <a href="admin.html">Administrators </a> who have the authority to Create Posts and Manage Candidate Selection. See the <a href="accessibility.html">Accessibility Options </a>for more details.

<p> <span class="style1">Warning</span> : It is better that the Administrator should first <a href="server_mgmt.html">Shut the User Server </a> before he creates a <a href = "post.html">Post</a>.
