<p>The Create Category Utility allows the <a href = "admin.html">Administrator</a> to create a <a href = "category.html">Category</a> ie. the subject for the test to be taken for a particular <a href = "post.html">Post</a>.The <a href = "category.html">Category</a> has the least fields of all with just the category name and the description. Every <a href = "category.html">Category</a> is identified by its name which is unique. The name of the <a href = "category.html">Category</a> is entered according to the prescribed <a href = "category.html">Name Field </a>standards and as specified in the <a href = "category.html">Category</a> specifications. If the user enters the category name which is already present in the database then the system will prompt to enter an alternative category name.</p>

<p>This Utility is only available for those <a href="admin.html">Administrators </a> who have the authority to Create Categories and Manage Exams. See the <a href="accessibility.html">Accessibility Options </a>for more details.
<p> <span class="style1">Warning</span> : It is better that the Administrator should first <a href="server%20shutdown.html">Shut the User Server </a> before he creates a <a href = "category.html">Category</a>.
