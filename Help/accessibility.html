<p>The <a href = "accessibility.html">Accessibility Options</a> is only accessible to the <a href = "superadmin.html">Super Administrator</a>. The <a href = "accessibility.html">Accessibility Options</a> allows the <a href = "superadmin.html">Super Administrator</a> to specify the security restrictions for the other <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a>. It includes the Accessibility Codes which are assigned to every administrator in the system which confines their access rights in the system. The Accessibility Codes are the one which decide the amount of access in the system. It helps to group the <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> according to their positions or designations.</p>
<p>The <a href = "accessibility.html">Accessibility Options</a> is divided into two parts, one is to change the <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a> of the <a href = "admin.html">Administrator</a> and the other is to change the Access Codes of the <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a>.</p>
<p>In the first part ie. the upper half contains the <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a> on one side and the <a href = "admin.html">Administrator</a> on the other side. By pressing the button 'Go' the page not only displays the Accessibility Rights for a particular <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a> but also lists the <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> who have the selected <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a>.</p>
<p>On the lower part there is the list of the Access Rights with the priority specified. The priority field indicates the priority given to the particular <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a>. The higher the priority the greater the access rights. Also the priority level indicates that all the priority levels below it are also accessible with its own specific access rights.</p>
<p>Also it is important to know that the access rights for the <a href = "accessibility.html">Accessibility Options</a> which is only accessible to the <a href = "superadmin.html">Super Administrator </a>be changed or modified by any means. So access and usage of <a href = "accessibility.html">Accessibility Options</a> is limited to the <a href = "superadmin.html">Super Administrator</a>.</p>
