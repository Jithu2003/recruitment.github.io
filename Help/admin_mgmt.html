<p>The <a href = "superadmin.html">Administrator</a> is the person who manages the system in order to function efficiently so that the maximum output can be achieved.</p>
<p>The System consists of the Administrator Area where the <a href = "candidate_selection.html">Candidate Selection</a> and the <a href = "exam_mgmt.html">Exam Management</a> is managed. The system allows to create a group of <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> which could work in co-ordination to manage the exam and the recruitment process. With the <a href = "superadmin.html">Super Administrator</a> on the top to control all the other <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a>, the system helps to group the <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> according to their <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a> and their Access Rights. The system allows not more than 100 <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> in the system including the <a href = "superadmin.html">SuperAdministrator</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a> is specified according to the Access Rights granted. So the <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a> divides the <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> into different types according to their Access rights.</p>
<p>The <a href = "superadmin.html">SuperAdministrator </a>is the <a href = "admin.html">Administrator</a> who cannot be deleted and has unrestricted Access Rights. While the other <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> specified in the <a href = "designation.html">Designation</a> act as the group of <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> who function at various levels below the <a href = "superadmin.html">SuperAdministrator</a> to manage the system efficiently. </p>
